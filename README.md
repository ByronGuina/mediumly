# Mediumly

Mediumly is an application used to read published articles written by users or publications on Medium.

## Running Locally

Both the backend and frontend projects were scaffolded using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/). You can substitude all of the below commands containing `yarn` to use the equivalent `npm` command instead.

### Start backend

```bash
yarn install:backend
yarn start:backend
```

### Start frontend

```bash
yarn install:frontend
yarn start:frontend
```
